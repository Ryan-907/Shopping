This is a Capstone project for my Programming Princples 1 class. Basically, it is a shopping cart. You add an item, describe it, set the price, and the quantity bought. If you make a mistake you can remove the item and put it back on the shelf! When you are satsified with your cart, you "check out" and it gives you the price. 
The shoppingCart.java file is the bulk of the code and Tester.java is the code implemented.
